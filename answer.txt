Question 1: ATE 
a) Linear regression estimation
We used ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression to estimate the parameters:
Intercept (α): 95.97
Average Treatment Effect (τ): -9.11
Coefficient for sustainability spending (β): 1.51

b) Estimated ATE and significance
The estimated ATE (τ̂) is -9.11, with a p-value of 0.0004.
This result is statistically significant at the 1% level.

c) Assumptions for causal interpretation
The causal interpretation of the estimated ATE requires the following assumptions:
Unconfoundedness: Treatment assignment must be independent of potential outcomes, conditional on observed covariates.
No omitted variable bias: All relevant confounders must be included in the regression.
Linearity and additive effects: The outcome is linearly related to the treatment and covariates.

Question 2
Predict Output:
{
  "W": 1.0,
  "X": 20.0,
  "predicted_engagement": 117.16
}
This means a company participating in the carbon offset program and spending $20,000 on sustainability is predicted to have a stakeholder engagement score of 117.16.

Explanation of Components:
The app.py file defines a Flask API that loads a linear regression model and provides a /predict endpoint to return predicted engagement scores based on input values. 
The Dockerfile containerizes the environment to ensure consistent dependencies and runtime. 
Containerization improves reproducibility and portability by isolating the application from local machine differences.
